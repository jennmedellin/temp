# Activating a Managed System

After a Teradata system is installed, all systems managed by Unity are placed in the Unrecoverable state. To synchronize data and bring all components in a managed system into the Active state, an administrator must activate the Teradata system. This operation is required for both high-availability (HA) and single system (non-HA) configurations.

Perform the following steps for each managed system.

1.  In the **Unity** portlet, click the **Dashboard** tab.
2.  Verify that components for the intended Active system are installed and configured properly.

    The **Components** pane shows all installed components and their current state.

3.  Click ![](nop1543850125563.gif) next to the system and select **Active**.

    All components in the managed system promote to the Active state.
