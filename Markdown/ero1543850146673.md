# ENDPOINT Configuration Parameters

|Parameter|Default|Scope|Option|Description|
|---------|-------|-----|------|-----------|
|<i>EndpointAddresses</i>|No default|Per Process|Required|<br/>​List of IP addresses and optional ports on which the Endpoint process listens for client requests. Use commas to separate multiple IP addresses.<br/><br/>​The format of this parameter is:<br/><br/>```​any[:port] | <ip>[:<port>][,<ip>[:<port>], ...]```<br/><br/><br/>​The keyword <span class="monospace CodeMirror">any</span> indicates that the Endpoint listens on all defined IP addresses on the Teradata system. The <span class="monospace CodeMirror">EndpointDefaultPort</span> parameter specifies the port value.<br/><br/>​If the keyword <span class="monospace CodeMirror">any</span> is not used, you can provide specific IP address values. The <span class="monospace CodeMirror"><port></span> value is optional. Any IP addresses given without a port value default to the value defined in the <span class="monospace CodeMirror">EndpointDefaultPort</span> parameter.<br/>|
|<i>EndpointDefaultPort</i>|1025|Per Process|Optional|<br/>​Port number for an IP address that is not defined as a port in <span class="monospace CodeMirror">EndpointAddresses</span>. Client applications and users connect to this port.<br/>|
|<i>EndpointSIPAddresses</i>|No default|Per Process|Optional|<br/>​List of Standby IP (SIP) addresses that the Endpoint process enables if Endpoints in other Regions are not available. Use commas to separate multiple SIP addresses. The SIP address values cannot be the same as the IP address values defined in <span class="monospace CodeMirror">EndpointAddresses</span> . If the <span class="monospace CodeMirror">EndpointAddresses</span> value is set to <span class="monospace CodeMirror">any</span> , the <span class="monospace CodeMirror">EndpointSIPAddresses</span> are ignored.<br/><br/>​The format of this parameter is:<br/><br/>```​<region> <ip>[:<port>][,<ip>[:<port>], ...][;<region> <ip>[:<port>][,<ip>[:<port>], ...]]```<br/><br/><br/>​Because this parameter can support the failover of Endpoint processes from multiple Regions, the <<i>region</i>> value specifies the name of the Regions for which the following IP address is enabled if the Endpoints in that Region are not available. For example:<br/><br/>```​toronto 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2; sandiego192.168.0.3, 192.168.0.4```<br/><br/><br/>​This example shows that if all Endpoints in the Toronto Region are unavailable, then this Endpoint enables 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 for available connections from clients that were connecting to the Endpoints in Toronto. It also specifies that if all the Endpoints in San Diego Region are unavailable, then this Endpoint enables 192.168.0.3 and 192.168.0.4 for available connections from clients that were connecting to Endpoints in San Diego.<br/><br/>​<b>Note:</b> The <<i>region</i>> in this parameter cannot be the same as the Region value for the Endpoint process. The <<i>ip</i>>:<<i>port</i>> values cannot be the same as those defined in the <i>EndpointAddresses</i> parameter.<br/><br/>​If the EndpointAddresses value is set to <span class="monospace CodeMirror">any</span>, then values in the <span class="monospace CodeMirror">EndpointSIPAddresses</span> are ignored.<br/>|
|<i>LoadCheckPointsLimit</i>|0 (Disabled)| | |When the parameter is set to 0, Unity does not check the number of allowed checkpoints. When the parameter is set to a positive number and the number of checkpoints exceeds the number,Unity aborts the load to all systems and forces a rollback. Unity returns an error 4536 to client: "Number of checkpoints exceeded checkpoint limit setting." Restarted loads count from zero again. For example, if the LoadCheckPointsLimit is set to 100, and a load job takes about 250 checkpoints, the Unity forces a rollback at checkpoint 101, then restarts the load and only counts the checkpoints for the restart. Then aborts after 100 and starts the load again until the load is complete. <ul><li>​If a load client sends several checkpoint 0, Unity only counts it once.</li><li>​If the Mload client sends several CHECPOINT interval 0 (or several same checkpoint interval value on restart), each of them is counted as a checkpoint seen. (The checkpoint interval value of the MLoad client can be less than the Checkpoint seen.)</li></ul> |
|<i>LoadDfsFileCloseAsync</i>|False| |Optional|With the default (<span class="monospace CodeMirror">False</span>) value, loads to managed multiple database systems are not completely asynchronous. Load files are written to remote nodes asynchronously. However, at a load checkpoint end or load end, when closing load data files, Unity waits for all outstanding remote load data writes to finish. Loads to multiple database systems are synchronized at the end of any checkpoints and the end of the loads.<br/>​When the parameter is set to true, loads to managed multiple database systems are completely asynchronous. Load data are written to remote nodes asynchronously and, at a load checkpoint end or load end, when closing load data files, Unity does not wait for all the outstanding remote writes of load data to finish. With the <span class="monospace CodeMirror">True</span> setting, if there is significant network delay or low network bandwidth between the two Unity regions, load clients complete the loads much faster, as loading to a single database system directly, right after completing the loads to the database system at the local region. Unity complete the loads to the database system at the remote region, in the background.<br/>|
|<i>ReadOvedrrideCport</i>|6001|Global|Optional|<br/>​Port on which Unity listens for sockclient commands.<br/><br/>​However, sockclient commands are no longer supported.<br/>|
