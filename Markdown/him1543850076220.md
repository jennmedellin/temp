# Adding a Managed Routing Rule

1.  In the **Unity Setup** portlet, click the **Session Routing** tab.
2.  Click the **Routing Rules** tab.
3.  Click ![](pjf1543850087170.gif).
4.  Next to **Routing Rules**, click ![](gbx1543850082273.gif).
5.  In **Rule Name**, type the name for this rule.

    Create a name that identifies the type of routing used for sessions that match this rule. For example, `readonly-rpref` indicates the routing rule is for Read-only Preferred routing.

6.  Select **Managed**.
7.  For Read-only routing, use the **Read Routing** list to select **Default** or **Preferred** and check two or more Teradata systems under the **Read** column.

  |Option|Description|
  |------|-----------|
  |Default|Unity selects the system with the shortest work queue and sends the Reads to that system.|
  |Preferred|All Read requests are sent to the first system in the list. If that system is unavailable, the Read session fails over to the next system in the list. There is no load balancing.|

8.  To specify where new objects are created, use **Create Routing**.

All writes are always sent to all systems on which the object exists. If an object exists on a system that is not part of the Write list, an error message appears.

  |Option|Description|
  |------|-----------|
  |Preferred|New objects are created on the first system in the list. If that system is unavailable, new objects are created on the next system in the list. There is no load balancing.|
  |Balanced|New objects are created on one of the systems specified in the system list. The system is picked at logon and all new objects for a given session are always sent to the same system. Unity balances the systems for each logon session.|
  |All|New objects are created on all systems. Default routing is applied.|

9.  Select the systems to use to send the reads and writes.

    If a system is selected for **Write**, it must also be selected for **Read**.

10. Using the **Error Profile** list, select the name of the error profile to associate with this routing rule.
11. Click **Save**.

    The new routing rule is added to the summary table.
