|<img src="oyz1543850073755.gif" alt="" />|Interrupted|An automatically recoverable transient error has occurred. If a Teradata system is interrupted, Read/Write requests are routed to a Standby Teradata system until the original system recovers from the error. All tables on an interrupted Teradata system are also placed in the Interrupted state. If a table is in an Interrupted state, the table cannot be accessed.|
