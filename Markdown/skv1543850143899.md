# Using Wildcards in Routing Rules

You can use a wildcard character (`*`) to define routing rules when more than one Teradata system is managed by Unity. Use of a wildcard creates a Preferred routing rule because it automatically includes multiple systems and a preferred order for Read/Writes and Failover.

You can use a wildcard character (`*`) for the `userid` and `accountstring` in user mappings. Unity recognizes four types of `userid` pattern matching and four types of `accountstring` pattern matching.

|Pattern|Description|Example|
|-------|-----------|-------|
|Exact match|Exact name match and exact account string match are always first choice in mappings.|<span class="monospace CodeMirror">patriciadarrell syssd1</span>|
|Trailing wildcard match|Field must start with the pattern.|<span class="monospace CodeMirror">pat* syssd*</span>|
|Leading wildcard match|Field must end with the pattern.|<span class="monospace CodeMirror">*darrell *sd1</span>|

**Note:** You cannot use a wildcard character (*) within a string. Use wildcards only at the beginning or end of the string.

When using wildcards, be careful with overlapping wildcards. A `userid` and `accountstring` could match multiple entries in the routing file. Unity uses the user mapping with the lowest ordinal value that matches the `userid` and `accountstring`.
